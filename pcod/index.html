    <h1 class="big-heading2">WHAT IS PCOS? </h1>
    
      <div id="rcorners1"><p class="text"><b>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, or PCOS</b>, is a health condition that affects about 10 million people in the world.</p>
        <p class="text">The exact cause is unknown, but it is considered a hormonal problem. Genetics and environmental factors are believed to be involved in the development of PCOS. It is a leading cause of female infertility and is responsible for a number of symptoms that can affect the body physically and emotionally.
          Despite the name, many people do not have cysts on their ovaries. In 2013, an independent panel of experts recommended to the National Institutes of Health that the name be changed because the name is confusing and hinders patient care and research efforts.
          PCOS symptoms and causes include irregular periods, excessive male-type hair growth, thinning of scalp hair, acne, obesity, difficulty in losing weight, dark patches of skin and infertility.</p>

        
        <p class="text">The exact polycystic ovarian syndrome causes are still not known</p>

      <h1 class="big-heading2">Symptoms and Causes </h1>
    
      <div id="rcorners2"><p class="text">Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition prevailing in women of reproductive age. PCOS can develop any time after a woman has had her first period (known as menarche). There are numerous instances where PCOS development can occur in later reproductive years as a response to certain hormonal factors. PCOS has various signs and symptoms-one felt by the patient, and one deduced by the doctor on thorough examination and medical counseling.

        In order to reach a definitive diagnosis of PCOS, your doctor will observe for at least one of these two symptoms.</p>
        <p class="text"><b>Irregular periods</b>
          This is the most commonly encountered symptom. The outcomes include menstrual intervals (time gap between two sequential periods) exceeding 30 days, four or more non-menstruating months, extended periods of more than eight days, with heavy or scant bleeding.</p>

        
          <p class="text"><b>Excess androgen</b>
            Another hallmark symptom of PCOS is excess secretion of the male hormone, androgen. This manifests in visible physical signs such as excess facial and body hair (hirsutism), adult or severe adolescent acne, and male pattern baldness, thinning of hair and excess hair on fingers of hands and toes, and on the surface of hands and legs.
            When observed under ultrasonography or any other imaging technique, polycystic ovaries are abnormally larger in size as compared with that of the normal ones and contain fluid-filled sacs that surround the eggs.</p>
            <p class="text" style="text-align: left;"> Other symptoms of PCOS include
              <ul style="text-align: left;">
              <li>Acne</li>
              <li>Weight loss</li>
              <li>Anxiety or depression</li>
              <li>Infertility</li>
            
            </ul></p>
          
            <p class="text">People with PCOS often have co-existing chronic disorders such as diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol, which should not be confounded as symptoms. These conditions lead to increased weight gain in PCOS patients.</p>

        


      </div>
      <h1 class="big-heading2">Is there a cure? </h1>
    
      <div id="rcorners3"><p class="text">The PCOS symptoms and treatment varies from patient to patient, and the medication is highly individualistic. Along with medication, lifestyle modification strategies such as physical exercise and a healthy diet prove to be of equal benefit and significance as that of medications for the PCOS symptoms and treatment.</p>
        <p class="text"><b>Lifestyle changes :</b>

          PCOS is highly associated with obesity (excess fat tissue in the body). Hence, as a lifestyle modification strategy, the doctor will first recommend losing weight by resorting to physical exercise and diet. The effectiveness of PCOS medications also tends to improve with reduced weight.
          
          As aforementioned, a low-fat diet is associated with significant improvements leading to the alleviation of symptoms of PCOS. A typically recommended weight loss amounts to a reduction of 5% of your body weight, for example: If your weight is say 60 kg, you need to lose your weight by at least 3 kg to start with.</p>

      <h1 class="big-heading2" style="margin-left: 120px;">What can you do to overpower PCOS? </h1>
    
      <div id="rcorners4"><p class="text">PCOS treatments focus on managing your individual concerns, such as infertility, hirsutism, acne, or obesity. PCOS treatments can include lifestyle changes like healthy eating and losing weight, or in some cases, medications can help. If a woman is not seeking to become pregnant, hormonal birth control (most often birth control pills) is a standard treatment. Here is a list of PCOS treatments available:</p>
        <p class="text" style="text-align: left;"> To help a woman with PCOS ovulate<ul style="text-align: left;">
          <li>Clomiphene</li>
          <li>Letrozole</li>
          <li>Metformin</li>
          <li>Gonadotropins</li>
        
        </ul></p>
        <p class="text" style="text-align: left;"> To reduce excessive hair growth<ul style="text-align: left;">
          <li> Birth control pills. These pills decrease androgen production that can cause excessive hair growth.</li>
          <li>Spironolactone</li>
          <li>Eflornithine</li>
          <li>Electrolysis</li>
        
        </ul></p>
        <p class="text" style="text-align: left;"> To regulate your menstrual cycle<ul style="text-align: left;">
          <li>            Combination birth control pills.</li>
          <li>            Progestin therapy.</li>
          
        
        </ul></p>
